_ _
:small_blue_diamond: **1 â€” Respect everyone.**
Our goal is to maintain a positive and inclusive community. Do not harass, target, instigate, discriminate against, or disrespect any member. Negative language directed at someone or something is *not* OK.
_ _
:small_blue_diamond: **2 â€” Do not post, discuss, or allude to sensitive topics or content.**
This includes pictures, statements, videos, and anything else that is racist, sexist, targeting disabilities, pornographic, or vulgar. 
_ _
:small_blue_diamond: **3 â€” Do not spam excessively.**
Do not spam excessively, flood the chat, or cause annoyance with it. Text walls (large blocks of text) are prohibited.

:small_blue_diamond: **4 â€” Do not bring in drama/issues from outside sources.**
Conflicts, debates, politics, and other sensitive topics from outside sources (including other servers, DMs, and other platforms) do not belong here.
_ _
:small_blue_diamond: **5 â€” Do not abuse @mentions (pinging).**
Please do not ping someone unnecessarily or to the point of annoyance. If there is an issue or emergency, contact a moderator!

Unless you have prior permission, do not use direct messaging to advertise or solicit content.
