🔷  __**Rules for the Vexento Music Discord Server**__
_ _
🔹 **1 — Respect everyone.**
Our goal is to maintain a positive and inclusive community. Do not harass, target, instigate, discriminate against, or disrespect any member. Negative language directed at someone or something is *not* OK.
_ _
🔹 **2 — Do not post, discuss, or allude to sensitive topics or content.**
This includes pictures, statements, videos, and anything else that is racist, sexist, targeting disabilities, pornographic, or vulgar. 
_ _
🔹 **3 — Do not spam excessively.**
Do not spam excessively, flood the chat, or cause annoyance with it. Text walls (large blocks of text) are prohibited.
_ _
🔹 **4 — Do not bring in drama/issues from outside sources.**
Conflicts, debates, politics, and other sensitive topics from outside sources (including other servers, DMs, and other platforms) do not belong here.
_ _
🔹 **5 — Do not abuse @mentions (pinging).**
Please do not ping someone unnecessarily or to the point of annoyance. If there is an issue or emergency, contact a moderator!
_ _
🔹 **6 — Do not advertise in DMs.**
Unless you have prior permission, do not use direct messaging to advertise or solicit content.
_ _
🔹**7 — Do not loophole the rules.**
The staff may take action if something you do is not explicitly mentioned in the rules. Use common sense: if you think you shouldn't do something then you probably shouldn't do it.
_ _
🔹 **8 — Follow Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.**
We abide by [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Discord's Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). Please review them.
