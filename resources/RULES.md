:large_blue_diamond:  __**Rules for the Vexento Music Discord Server**__

:small_blue_diamond: **1 â€” Respect everyone.**
Our goal is to maintain a positive and inclusive community. Do not harass, target, instigate, discriminate against, or disrespect any member. Negative language directed at someone or something is *not* OK.

:small_blue_diamond: **2 â€” Do not post, discuss, or allude to sensitive topics or content.**
This includes pictures, statements, videos, and anything else that is racist, sexist, targeting disabilities, pornographic, or vulgar. 

:small_blue_diamond: **3 â€” Do not spam excessively.**
Do not spam excessively, flood the chat, or cause annoyance with it. Text walls (large blocks of text) are prohibited.

:small_blue_diamond: **4 â€” Do not bring in drama/issues from outside sources.**
Conflicts, debates, politics, and other sensitive topics from outside sources (including other servers, DMs, and other platforms) do not belong here.

:small_blue_diamond: **5 â€” Do not abuse @mentions (pinging).**
Please do not ping someone without a reason or to the point of annoyance. If there is an issue or emergency, contact a moderator first!

:small_blue_diamond: **6 â€” Do not advertise in DMs.**
Unless you have prior consent, do not use direct messaging to advertise or solicit content.

:small_blue_diamond:**7 â€” Do not loophole the rules.**
The staff may take action if something you do is not explicitly mentioned in the rules. Use common sense: if you think you shouldn't do something then you probably shouldn't do it.

:small_blue_diamond: **8 â€” Follow Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.**
We abide by [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Discord's Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). Please review them.

:small_orange_diamond: **Enjoy your stay!**
These rules are here to ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience, so please follow them. We hope you enjoy your stay! :FBhug2:
